## Overview

This repository, **ProgressBar-in-Python**, allows you to create a simple and effective progress bar using the `tqdm` library in Python. The `tqdm` library provides a fast, extensible progress bar for loops and other iterable objects in Python. It can be used in both CLI and GUI applications.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the `tqdm` library. You can do this using pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install tqdm
```

For further releases, you can visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/ahussnain95e/ProgressBar-in-Python/releases) to download the latest version.

## Usage

Using the `tqdm` library is straightforward. Below is a simple example of how to implement a progress bar in your Python script.

```python
from tqdm import tqdm
import time

# Example of a simple loop with a progress bar
for i in tqdm(range(100)):
    time.sleep(0.1)  # Simulate work being done
```

In this example, the progress bar will display as the loop iterates from 0 to 99, updating in real-time.

## Features

- **Easy to Use**: Simple integration into existing code.
- **Customizable**: Modify the appearance and behavior of the progress bar.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead for performance.
- **Versatile**: Works with any iterable in Python.
- **CLI and GUI Support**: Can be used in terminal applications as well as graphical interfaces.

## Examples

### Basic Example

Here's a basic example of using `tqdm` with a list of items:

```python
from tqdm import tqdm
import time

items = list(range(10))

for item in tqdm(items):
    time.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate some work
```

### Nested Progress Bars

You can also create nested progress bars:

```python
from tqdm import tqdm
import time

for i in tqdm(range(3), desc="Outer Loop"):
    for j in tqdm(range(5), desc="Inner Loop", leave=False):
        time.sleep(0.2)
```

### Using with Pandas

If you work with Pandas, you can integrate `tqdm` for progress tracking in data processing:

```python
import pandas as pd
from tqdm import tqdm

tqdm.pandas()  # Integrate tqdm with pandas

df = pd.DataFrame({'a': range(1000)})

# Use progress_apply instead of apply
df['b'] = df['a'].progress_apply(lambda x: x * 2)
```
